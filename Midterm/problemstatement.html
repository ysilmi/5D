    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>I have been in this situation more than once. And I know that my fellow classmates have as
well. It's the night before a huge test and you have so many questions or want to study with
people that are taking the same class, but you forgot your classmates phone numbers. Now,
you don't know how to reach them or when they are available to have a study session.
Define a solution (the right solution?)
One of the best ways to learn tough new material is through problem solving with a group.
Sometimes, other people can point out things that you didn't notice, and vise versa. My proposal
is a interactive tool that connects students who are taking a similar classes. These students will
be able to join the interactive platform and chat with other students who are in the same class
as them.  


This interactive tool will connect and unify students though geo-location.</p>
